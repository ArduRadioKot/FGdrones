# Fg drones
The FGsDrones project is designed to assemble and program drones. The main tool used is the FGD programming language (a simplified version of FroggeeScript).
 ---
The project includes the following components:

* Web simulator - designed for quick testing of drone programs without using additional modules.
  
* Game - provides the ability to assemble drones, program them and use them in various scenarios.
  
* IDE and code editor - allow you to create programs for drones and download them directly to devices. It also supports the installation of your own modules to expand the functionality of drones. The list of supported modules can be found in the project documentation.

This project is aimed at a wide audience, including beginners, teachers, organizers and participants of robotics and programming competitions. It provides convenient tools for learning the basics of drone programming, creating your own projects and participating in competitions of various levels.
